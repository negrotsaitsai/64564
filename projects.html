								<h1>What is India's caste system? </h1>
								<p>The system which divides Hindus into rigid hierarchical groups based on their karma
									(work) and dharma (the Hindi word for religion, but here it means duty) is generally
									accepted to be more than 3,000 years old.</p>
								<p> At the top of the hierarchy were the Brahmins who were mainly teachers and
									intellectuals and are believed to have come from Brahma's head. Then came the
									Kshatriyas, or the warriors and rulers, supposedly from his arms. The third slot
									went to the Vaishyas, or the traders, who were created from his thighs. At the
									bottom of the heap were the Shudras, who came from Brahma's feet and did all the
									menial jobs.

								<p>The main castes were further divided into about 3,000 castes and 25,000 sub-castes,
									each based on their specific occupation.</p>

								<p> Outside of this Hindu caste system were the achhoots - the Dalits or the
									untouchables.</p>
								<p>For centuries, caste has dictated almost every aspect of Hindu religious and social
									life, with each group occupying a specific place in this complex hierarchy.</p>

								<p> Rural communities have long been arranged on the basis of castes - the upper and
									lower castes almost always lived in segregated colonies, the water wells were not
									shared, Brahmins would not accept food or drink from the Shudras, and one could
									marry only within one's caste.</p>
								<p>The system bestowed many privileges on the upper castes while sanctioning repression
									of the lower castes by privileged groups.</p>

								<p>Often criticised for being unjust and regressive, it remained virtually unchanged for
									centuries, trapping people into fixed social orders from which it was impossible to
									escape.</p>

								<p> Despite the obstacles, however, some Dalits and other low-caste Indians, such as BR
									Ambedkar who authored the Indian constitution, and KR Narayanan who became the
									nation's first Dalit president, have risen to hold prestigious positions in the
									country.</p>

								<p>Historians, though, say that until the 18th Century, the formal distinctions of
									caste were of limited importance to Indians, social identities were much more
									flexible and people could move easily from one caste to another.</p>

								<p>New research shows that hard boundaries were set by British colonial rulers who made
									caste India's defining social feature when they used censuses to simplify the
									system, primarily to create a single society with a common law that could be easily
									governed.</p>

								<h1>The system of legal</h1>
								<p>Independent India's constitution banned discrimination on the basis of caste, and, in
									an attempt to correct historical injustices and provide a level playing field to the
									traditionally disadvantaged, the authorities announced quotas in government jobs and
									educational institutions for scheduled castes and tribes, the lowest in the caste
									hierarchy, in 1950.</p>
								<p>In 1989, quotas were extended to include a grouping called the OBCs (Other Backward
									Classes) which fall between the traditional upper castes and the lowest.</p>

								<p>In recent decades, with the spread of secular education and growing urbanisation,
									the influence of caste has somewhat declined, especially in cities where different
									castes live side-by-side and inter-caste marriages are becoming more common.</p>

								<p>In certain southern states and in the northern state of Bihar, many people began
									using just one name after social reform movements. Despite the changes though, caste
									identities remain strong, and last names are almost always indications of what caste
									a person belongs to.</p>
